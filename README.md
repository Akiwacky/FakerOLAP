# OLTP to OLAP Transformation using SQL in Jupyter Notebook


## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook shows the process of transforming an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database into an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) database using Microsoft SQL Server. The notebook encompasses a variety of SQL scripts including the utilization of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries to enhance and add calculated columns to the fact table as well as indexing and  data quality checks.

## Objectives
- **Data Transformation**: Convert an OLTP database schema to an OLAP database schema to optimize it for analytical and reporting purposes.
- **Indexing**: Add relevant indexes to improve query performance.
- **Data Quality**: Implement scripts to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Utilize CTEs and subqueries for complex data manipulation and to add calculated columns to the fact table.
